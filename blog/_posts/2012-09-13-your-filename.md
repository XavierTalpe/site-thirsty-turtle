# Daily Notes

* First cooking class of this semester. Had a great time as usual.

* Sometimes I think I'm crazy for leaving Belgium and going to Canada instead.

* Had lunch at the Diamant building. Their sandwiches + dessert are the best.
* A customer file went missing at work. Somebody put up a western bounty report.
* Doing research on a possible scenario and replay tool for the emergency domain.
