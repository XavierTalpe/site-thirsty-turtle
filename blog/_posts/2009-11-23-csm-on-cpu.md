Some screenshots of my current implementation on the CPU (uncompressed):

Notice the banding of the shadows in the last picture. This is a consequence of using "only" 1024 shadow maps. With four times as much shadow maps there is a considerable improvement:

Currently I'm still using an uncompressed version of the algorithm. Task for this week however is to integrate the compression so I can go full-scale. If I find some time I'll try to make a render using 16k uncompressed shadow maps (which is already 2Gb of data to put in memory).
