  <h2> Introduction</h2>

  <p>In the year 2009-2010 I did my master thesis at the the <a href="http://www.kuleuven.be/english/"
                                                                target="_blank">Catholic University of Leuven</a>. My
    thesis was based on a paper of Tobias Ritschel: <a href="http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~ritschel/Papers/CSM.pdf"
                                                       target="_blank">Interactive Illumination with Coherent Shadow
      Maps</a>. My promotor was <a href="http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~philip.dutre/" target="_blank">Prof. dr. ir.
      Philip Dutr√©</a> and my personal thesis coach was <a
        href="http://be.linkedin.com/pub/jurgen-laurijssen/3/721/151"
        target="_blank">ir. Jurgen Laurijssen</a>. The full (dutch) report of my thesis can be
    downloaded <a href="/uploads/files/Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (loading can take a while because of all
    the nice images).

  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <p>Rendering realistic shadows in 3D scenes typically requires many expensive visibility queries. The visibility
    information of a three dimensional object can however be pre-calculated using shadow maps. By exploiting the
    coherence between these maps, a compact and easily accessible representation is possible. This allows for
    real-time
    rendering of realistic shadows. In my thesis I investigated if a more compact representation of the shadow maps is
    possible, and how accurate the technique of coherent shadow maps is.
