<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Personal information</h2>
<p>
  My name is Xavier, Iâ€™m 25 years old and currently working as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.luciad.com"
                                                                                         target="_blank">Luciad</a>,
  Belgium. I have a strong interest in innovative (multimedia) technologies and in particular anything related to 3D
  visualization. Whether it be video games, animation movies or medical imaging, anything related to computer graphics,
  computer vision or augmented/diminished reality grabs my attention. Besides programming, I read a lot of books
  (especially fantasy novels) and I am also an amateur poker player.
