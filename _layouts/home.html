          <p>Fun Cat LOL</p>
        </aside>

        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
          men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
          darkness,
          for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with
          great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know
          My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

        <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I’m not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know
          how
          you can tell who the arch-villain’s going to be? He’s the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they’re
          friends, like you and me! I should’ve known way back when… You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
          called
          me Mr Glass.</p>

        <p>Your bones don’t break, mine do. That’s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
          mine.
          You don’t get sick, I do. That’s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
          We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
          connected, you and I. We’re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
