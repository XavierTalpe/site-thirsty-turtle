Last week I've created a small program which allows me to render all of my compressed depth maps separately. This way I can manually look at each depth map and get an idea of how correct they are. I also implemented a way to render what I callÂ **Coherence Maps**. These maps give an idea on how coherent each pixel is over all depth maps. When a pixel is white, it means that the depth value for this pixel is the same for all depth maps, and thus we have perfect coherence. A black pixel means the opposite, namely a lot of variation in the depth values for that pixel. This means a low coherence and low compression rate.

Some examples of these coherence maps are shown below:
