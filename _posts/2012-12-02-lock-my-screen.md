title: 'Lock my Screen - One month later'
---

Exactly one month and a day ago I released my first Android app. Lock my Screen is a tiny app that allows you to activate the lock screen of your phone without using the hardware button of your phone. Instead, you tap the app icon and the lock screen is activated. That's it. It doesn't do anything else, it's just a super-small and clean app specifically developed for this use case.

So why did I develop something this silly? Especially with all the experience I have, why waste my time on this? My main motivation though was to get something out on the Google Play Store and see how it goes. In the past years I've said multiple times I want to develop some Android apps on my own, but so far I never actually published anything. Before spending months on developing some 'genius' app, I first wanted to have a feel for how an app evolves over time. Do you need advertisements in order to get visibility for your app? How do people get to know your app? And is it possible to make a profit developing Android apps?

Based on other apps in the Google Play Store, I discovered there's a market for apps that show/disable the lock screen of your phone. Since most of these apps are SUPER simple, I decided my first app would be called "Lock my Screen" and in terms of functionality, it would do _exactly_ what the name suggests.

Right before I published my app, I was wondering how many people on Earth would actually download (and use) my app? I mean, it's not like this was the holy grail (or anything even _close_ to that). To my own suprise however, quite a lot of people showed interest in my app.

After 24 hours, I had my first two downloads (_great succes_). Both of my users came from Saudi Arabia and apparently they told their friends about my app because in the next days all of my downloads would come from Saudi Arabia. Ten days after launching my app and I had 100 downloads from Saudi Arabia vs. 20 from India and 10 from the US. To date, 20% of all downloads happened in Saudi Arabia. شكرا لكم أيها الرجال (thanks guys!)
