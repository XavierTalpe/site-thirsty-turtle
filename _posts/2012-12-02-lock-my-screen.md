title: 'Lock my Screen - One month later'
---

Exactly one month and a day ago I released my first Android 'app'. Lock my Screen is a tiny app that allows you to activate the lock screen of your phone without using the hardware button of your phone. Instead, you tap the app icon and the lock screen is activated. And that's _it_. It doesn't do anything else, it's just a super-small and clean app _specifically_ developed for this use case.

So why did I develop something this silly? Mainly to get something out on the Google Play Store and see how it goes. In the past years I've said multiple times I want to develop some Android apps on my own, but so far I never actually published anything. Before spending months on developing some 'genius' app, I first wanted to have a feel for how an app evolves over time. Do you need advertisements in order to get visibility for your app? How do people get to know your app? And would it be possible to actually earn money with it?

Based on other apps in the Google Play Store, I discovered there's a market for apps that show/disable the lock screen of your phone. Since most of these apps are SUPER simple, I decided my first app would be called "Lock my Screen" and it would do just that.

Honestly, right before I published my app, I was wondering who on Earth was going to download an app like that? To my own suprise, quite a lot of people actually... After 24 hours later, I had my first two downloads. Both of them in Saudi Arabia.
