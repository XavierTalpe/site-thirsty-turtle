title: 'Lock my Screen - One month later'
---

Exactly one month and a day ago I released my first Android app. Lock my Screen is a tiny app that allows you to activate the lock screen of your phone without using the hardware button of your phone. Instead, you tap the app icon and the lock screen is activated. That's it. It doesn't do anything else, it's just a small and clean app specifically developed for this use case.

So why did I develop something this silly? Especially with all the experience I have, why waste my time on this? My main motivation though was to get something out on the Google Play Store and see how it goes. In the past years I've said multiple times I want to develop some Android apps on my own, but so far I never actually published anything. Before spending months on developing some 'genius' app, I first wanted to have a feel for how an app evolves over time. Do you need advertisements in order to get visibility for an app? How do people get to know an app? And is it possible to make a profit developing Android apps?

Based on other apps in the Google Play Store, I discovered there's a market for apps that show/disable the lock screen of your phone. Since most of these apps are SUPER simple, I decided my first app would be called "Lock my Screen" and in terms of functionality, it would do _exactly_ what the name suggests.

Right before I published my app, I was wondering how many people on Earth would actually download (and use) my app? I mean, it's not like this was the holy grail (or anything even close to that). To my own suprise however, quite a lot of people showed interest in my app.

After 24 hours, I had my first two downloads, _great succes_. Both of my users came from Saudi Arabia and apparently they told their friends about my app because in the next days all of my downloads would come from Saudi Arabia. Ten days after launching my app and I had 100 downloads from Saudi Arabia vs. 20 from India and 10 from the US. To date, 20% of all downloads happened in Saudi Arabia. شكرا لكم أيها الرجال (that's Arabic for "thanks guys".) So obviously word of mouth has a big effect on the visibility of an app.

Another influential factor are updates for your app. Every time you release an update, your app is shown in the list of "new apps" in the Google Play Store. Of course with thousands of apps being updated every day, the chance of your app being picked up is still small. However, I did notice a tiny increase in the number of downloads every time I released a new update. This in turn increases the chances of penetrating a social circle (as happened in Saudi Arabia).

After one month my app has *2800 downloads* and *1650 active installs*. Far more than what I expected to achieve in one month. My app has been downloaded numerous times in Saudi Arabia, India, USA, Vietnam, Malaysia, Russia... It's amazing to see so many people use an app that you developed yourselves.

So based on the everything I learned in the past month, I believe it should indeed be possible to make a profit by developing Android apps. Now the only thing I need are some great ideas...
