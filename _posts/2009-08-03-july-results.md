Had a decent month, probably my biggest so far. Sucks to run under EV though. If it wasn't for my downswing halfway the month, I would've probably hit the $ 1,000 mark :(.

I'm also making some small changes to my game. Currently my non-showdown winnings are taking up a huge chunk of my winnings and I want them close to break-even before I move up to 100NL. Using Holdem Manager I did some analysis of my game:

- Multiway pots are very unprofitable for me, so I plan on getting less involved in these. Also going to look for some profitable spots where I can 3-bet instead of calling.
- I get way to much involved with fish donkbetting, minraising and minbetting me. Calling two streets only to fold to a river bet is costing me to much money atm.
- More punishing the limpers when sitting in the blinds! I never expected this to be so profitable, but HEM statistics really convinced me to raise with almost ATC. People fold so often!
