Barely found time to play this month because of my thesis. In total I only played a mere 7.5 hours! Not to mention I spend more than half of that time playing 10NL. Yep, 10NL, ten times lower than my regular stake that is. Mainly played the micro's as a form of practice and trying to keep myself on the grind (which obviously didn't work). Hope to get back into my A-game soon and make another 1K+ month.
