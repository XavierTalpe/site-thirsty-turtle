Today I ordered [The Cg Tutorial: The Definitive Guide to Programmable Real-Time Graphics](http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cg_tutorial_home.html) for my thesis. Though CUDA will probably be the main languague I'll be working in, Cg is still used alot in computer graphics industry. At first I was going to print it (it's published for [free](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter01.html)), but that's not near as enjoyable as the real book. So I bought it! :)
