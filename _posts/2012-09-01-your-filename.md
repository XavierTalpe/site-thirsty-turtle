Besides taking a summer break I continued reading on OpenGL and Cg. CUDA will be for this week (the first chapters look promising though). Yesterday I also started collecting all my papers for my bibliography. Some of them are only available at the [ACM](http://www.acm.org) it seems, so tomorrow I'll bring a visit to the KULAK library!
