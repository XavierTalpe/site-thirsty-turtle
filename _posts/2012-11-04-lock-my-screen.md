title: "Lock my Screen, an Android App."
---

Last week I released my first app in the Google Play store. It's a simple app that allows you to lock your screen by tapping an icon. So what's wrong with just using the hardware button on your phone you say? Well, *nothing* actually. But apparently there's a bunch of people who are scared of wearing out the hardware button so they prefer to use an app for locking their device.

So I made an app that does exactly that. Press the icon and the screen is locked. No settings, no adds, it just works. All devices running Android 2.2 and up are supported. To find it in the Google Play store, just click the link below!
